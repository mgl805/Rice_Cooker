Notes
=====

The better part of this example came from Andy Moncsek's demo pom file.
The primary issue I ran into, was getting the example to run/debug from
within my IDE, in this case NetBeans 7.2.  I thought it was a maven issue
until I realized the example runs from the command line after a successful build
from the IDE or command line.  Next I thought it was a NetBeans issue.  Ultimately
I realized NetBeans could not find the JavaFX runtime when it launches the program.
I solved it by adding a symbolic link to jfxrt.jar in the extensions directory.

on OS X from /Library/Java/Extensions
ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_74/Contents/Home/jre/lib/jfxrt.jar .
